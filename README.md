# bridges-nyc
Work associated with nyc bridge investigation. I was trying to find possible sources to speak to about bridges. Public officials, board members, and impassioned community voices.  
1. Web scrape of the minutes of Bronx community board's general meetings 2018-2024. Downloaded dozens of PDFs.
2. Text analysis. Using Glob, OCR, Fuzzy-context-finder, and tab2text to find keywords (and their context) throughout all the PDFs downloaded.
3. A few notebooks of where I used python code to quickly scrape, download and organize massive National Bridge Inspection data for New York City to look at comparisons between different years.

Through this process I was able to find the names of certain community board members who had commented on bridges throughout their tenure. Gave me a good place to start reaching out to sources. 

This project is very repeatable for looking at meeting minutes, speeches or any database of text.
One example of other possible application: Political speech. X candidate talks about the danger of regressive taxation. Using the minutes of the legislative session, how many times did X candidate talk about taxation and in what context? Do their words match their public persona?
